h1. Digestif

An aid for creating hash digests of large files

h2. Synopsis TODO

Digestif lets you create fast checksums of large files by 
skipping sections of the file.  It was created with compressed media 
files in mind, which generally have such a high information density
that we can get away with a checksum that doesn't actually consider all
the bits.  Someday I'd like to understand the likelyhood-of-collision
implications for specific compression algorithms (mp3, h.264, xvid, et al.),
but right now I'm going to settle for guessing at where "good enough for me"
might lie.

h2. Installation TODO
h2. Usage TODO
h2. Motivation

I wrote digestif to solve a problem for a media catalogue I was working on.
I wanted a filename-independent way to evaluate whether or not a file was in
the catalogue yet, but the files were so large that streaming the whole file
off of the hard drive was too slow for the response time I was hoping for.
(Interested parties, I was getting 5 gigs hashed using md5 in about 2.4
minutes.)
